Hello i'm Sawsan Almuzaiyen
my major is Computer Science.
I’m excited to take this course because it matches my personality.
I enjoy challenges, analysis, and thinking through problems step by step,
and Machine Learning feels like a field where I can combine these skills with technology in a practical way.
